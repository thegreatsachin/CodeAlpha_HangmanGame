\# Hangman Game



A simple, command-line-based Hangman game created in Python. This project is a great exercise for beginners learning fundamental Python concepts.



\## Goal



The objective was to create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses.



\## Features



\*   \*\*Predefined Word List:\*\* The game randomly selects a word from a small, built-in list.

\*   \*\*Limited Lives:\*\* The player has 6 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

\*   \*\*Console Interface:\*\* The game runs entirely in the console, with basic text input and output.



\## How to Play



1\.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2\.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

3\.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4\.  Run the game with the following command:

&nbsp;   ```

&nbsp;   python HangmanGame.py

&nbsp;   ```

5\.  Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters and try to solve the word!



\## Key Concepts Used



This project utilizes several core Python concepts, including:

\*   `random` module for word selection

\*   `while` loops to control the game flow

\*   `if-else` statements for conditional logic

\*   `strings` and `lists` for data manipulation
